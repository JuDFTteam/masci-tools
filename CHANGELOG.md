## v.0.11.3
[full changelog](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/compare/v0.11.2...v0.11.3)

### Improvements
- Changes to KKR plotting routine `dispersionplot` for compatibility with AiiDA v2.0
- Connecting vectors for intersite `GreensFunction` are now saved in Angstroem. For better interoperability with ase, pymatgen, AiiDA

### For Developers
- Relaxed CI requirements for docs build. Nitpicky mode is no longer required to pass but is treated as a hint to look into the warnings

## v.0.11.2
[full changelog](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/compare/v0.11.1...v0.11.2)

### Improvements
- Several changes in KKR IO functions to make them compatible with `aiida-core>=2.0` [[#175]](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/pull/175)
- Add function to calculate fourier transform of e.g. `J_ij` constants calculated from Green's functions (`masci_tools.tools.greensf_calculations.heisenberg_reciprocal`)

### Bugfixes
- Fixed nondeterministic order in bokeh regression tests if multiple dictionaries with the same values but differing keys in the same list (e.g. Providing the same data for different columns)
- Fixed wrong names for columns entered in `decompose_jij_tensor`, i.e. `J_ji` -> `J_ij`

### Deprecations
- Deprecated the unused modules `util/kkr_rms_tracker.py` and `util/modify_potential.py`

## v.0.11.1

[full changelog](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/compare/v0.11.0...v0.11.1)

### Bugfixes
- Bugfix in `reverse_xinclude`. Version `0.11.0` broke this function for versions, where the `relaxation` tag was not allowed.

## v.0.11.0
[full changelog](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/compare/v0.10.1...v0.11.0)

This release adds some improvements to the XML and HDF5 handling mainly for better AiiDA-Fleur
support. Also major updates to documentation configurations and Green's function calculations.

### Added
- Added `FleurElementMaker` class. This can be used to create XML elements compatible with a given version from scratch.
  Has case-insensitivity and converts values to strings for XML [[#159]](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/pull/159)
  Example
  ```python
   from masci_tools.util.xml.builder import FleurElementMaker
   E = FleurElementMaker.fromVersion('0.35')
   new_kpointset = E.kpointlist(
       *(
           E.kpoint(kpoint, weight=weight, label=special_labels[indx]) if indx in special_labels else
           E.kpoint(kpoint, weight=weight) for indx, (kpoint, weight) in enumerate(zip(kpoints, weights))
       ),
       name=name,
       count=nkpts,
       type=kpoint_type)
  ```
- Function `serialize_xml_arguments` to `masci_tools.util.xml.common_functions` to remove XML elements/trees from positional/keyword arguments and replace them with string representations of the XML. Can be used in AiiDA-Fleur
- Module `masci_tools.util.ipython` and ipython extension (`%load_ext masci_tools`). Adds syntax highlighted XML tree output and creating HTML syntax highlighted diffs of XML trees [[#158]](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/pull/158)
- Added calculation of Jij Tensor from intersite Green's functions [[#170]](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/pull/170)

### Improvements
- Added `name` entry to `SchemaDict.tag_info` which contains the tag name in the original case [[#159]](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/pull/159)
- `convert_to_xml` is made more strict. Conversion `int` to `str` uses the `{:d}` format specifier and string conversion is no longer always attempted [[#159]](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/pull/159)
- Improvements to Colorbar creation in matplotlib plotting methods. Limits are now set consistently with `limits={'color': (low, high)}` in the plot and colorbar. Spinpolarized bandplots now show two colorbars for the two colormaps if requested
- `get_parameter_data` now also extracts the `gamma` switch for kpoint generation for more consistent roundtrips. This is only set if the first kpoint in the mesh is the gamma point and there are multiple
- `load_inpxml` and `load_outxml` now consistently accept the XML file given as a
string of the content. The content no longer has to be manually encoded as bytes
- The method `FleurXMLModifier.modify_xmlfile` now always returns two things. The modified XML tree and a dictionary with all additional file contents, e.g. `n_mmp_mat`.
- Support for aligning spin/real-space frames of Green's functions. Several further imporvements/bugfixes for Green's function modules [[#170]](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/pull/170)

### Bugfixes
- Bugfix for `outxml_parser` returning a nested list for Hubbard 1 distances, where a flat list was expected. Removed `force_list` argument from the parsing task definition
- Fixes in `plot_fleur_bands`, when providing custom weights without spin suffixes, i.e. `_up`/`_down`
- Fix in `HDF5Reader`. IO like objects without an attached filename would lead to an  early error. This is the case for example for some readers in the file repository implementation used in AiiDA v2.0
- Fix in `HDF5Reader`. The file handles for compressed files in the AiiDA v2 repository have to be copied into a temporary file first before they can be used

### For Developers
- Docs: Updated `sphinx` and `sphinx-autodoc-typehints` versions and build docs on python 3.10 [[#156]](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/pull/156)
- Docs: Converted to `MyST` markdown and where appropriate introduced `myst-nb` for executing code cells in the documentation, e.g. generate plotting examples [[#157]](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/pull/157)
- Bokeh regression tests now strip out the bokeh version from the test files
- Added pre-commit hook, which generates the docstrings for the `FleurXMLModifier` registration methods from their XML setter function counterparts [[#166]](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/pull/166)

## v0.10.1
[full changelog](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/compare/v0.10.0...v0.10.1)

### Bugfixes
- Remove accidentally left in debug print in `outxml_parser`

## v.0.10.0
[full changelog](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/compare/v0.9.1...v0.10.0)

This release provides several new features in the XML modification/evaluation for Fleur XML files and bugfixes. Multiple problems when
working with DFT+U density matrix files are also fixed.
### Added
- New XML setter `align_nmmpmat_to_sqa` to rotate the density matrix file according to SQAs specified either for noco or second variation SOC [[#140]](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/pull/140)
- Added `task_list` property to `FleurXMLModifier` to construct a list which can be used to replicate the same `FleurXMLModifier` with the `fromList()` classmethod [[#149]](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/pull/149)
- Added `FleurXMLContext`, which acts as a holder of th XML elements,  schema dictionary, constants and logger to reduce the amount of information/clutter in functions evaluating things from the XML file [[#152]](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/pull/152)

  Note: The class `ParseTasks` used in the `outxml_parser` was simplified and placed into the `outxml_parser` module and the decorator `register_parsing_function` was removed. This was done without deprecation since they were exclusively used in the `outxml_parser` and were the main cause of cyclic import problems previously
- Added several predefined conversions to/from input version `0.35` to `inpxml_converter` [[#153]](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/pull/153)

### Improvements
- Added `inverse` argument to nmmpmat XML setters. These will correctly produce the inverse rotation operation for the given angles. Also allow setting `orbital='all'` in `rotate_nmmpmat` to rotate all blocks by the given angles [[#140]](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/pull/140)
- The XML setters `create_tag`, `replace_tag` and their low-level equivalents now also accept XML strings, i.e. `<example attribute="1"/>`, as arguments for the elements to create/replace [[#145]](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/pull/145)
### Bugfixes
- Fix for XML setters operating on the DFT+U density matrix file. Previously these functions would not map the density matrix blocks correctly if multiple atomgroups shared the same species containing `ldaU` tags [[#140]](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/pull/140)
- Added missing prefactor `(-1)^(m-mp)` to `get_wigner_matrix()`
- Added basic tests of `masci_tools.tools.greensfunction` module and fixed several bugs found due to this [[#150]](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/pull/150)
- Fixed bug in XML setters operating on the DFT+U density matrix file not correctly extracting the number of spin blocks when only setting `l_mperp`
- Fixed bug, when using the `FleurXMLModifier` directly (not in `aiida-fleur`), included XML files were not handled
- Fixed bug in `outxml_parser`, when the XML file had to be repaired and more than one iteration was present the wrong iteration was chosen as the last stable iteration [[#152]](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/pull/152)

### Deprecated
- The module `masci_tools.io.io_fleurxml` is renamed to `masci_tools.io.fleur_xml` [[#152]](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/pull/152)
- The module `masci_tools.util.parse_task_decorator` is removed. All decorators are now availaibe under `masci_tools.io.parsers.fleur` [[#152]](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/pull/152)

### For Developers
- Added `py.typed` marker to masci-tools, since a large part of the outside facing code (especially the XML APIs are typed). With this marker other packages can use the typehints in this package

## v.0.9.1
[full changelog](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/compare/v0.9.0...v0.9.1)

### Added
- Standalone function `masci_tools.tools.fleur_inpxml_converter.convert_inpxml` to allow conversions of `inp.xml` files within a python runtime without needing to go via the commandline

### Bugfixes
- Fixed bug in bokeh testing fixtures using the wrong folder for fallback versions
- Fixed bug not correctly converting complex numbers from the Fleur xml files if they have whitespace at beginning/end

## v.0.9.0
[full changelog](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/compare/v0.8.0...v0.9.0)

### Added
- New `bokeh` plot routine for matrix plot of rectangle patches with added texts [[#124]](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/pull/124)
- Added TS contribution to free energy to output of `outxml_parser`

### Improvements
- Several arguments in XML setter functions were renamed for more consistent signatures.
  The main changes are 
   - `attributedict`/`change_dict` -> `changes`
   - `attributename`/`attribv` -> `name`/`value`
   - `add_number` -> `number_to_add`
  
  The old signatures are still supported with deprecations if called via the `FleurXMLModifier` [[#118]](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/pull/118)
- Remove constraint on `bokeh` version (previously `<=1.4.0`) [[#122]](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/pull/122)
- Add `only_spin` option and calculate complete non-spinpolarized DOS for `spinpol=False` in `plot_fleur_dos` [[#125]](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/pull/125)
- Refactored `CFCalculation`, i.e. naming of attributes handling of cutoffs. Added classmethod to construct instance directly from numpy arrays [[#127]](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/pull/127)
- Refactored plotting methods for `CFCalculation` to allow the same parameter freedom as for the other matplolib routines [[#127]](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/pull/127)
- Improvement to labels and legends in DOS/bandstructure plots. Matplotlib plots now put the legend centered below the plot and added latex labels to axis and ticks in bokeh (version `2.4.0` needed) [[#133]](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/pull/133)
- `io_nmmpmat`: Allow negative indices in `read_nmmpmat_block` and raise error for invalid index
### Bugfixes
- Fix for signatures of `set_text`/`set_first_text`. These contained names of attribute setting functions [[#118]](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/pull/118)
- Fix for validating arguments in `FleurXMLModifier` not accepting an argument named `name` when passed by keyword. [[#118]](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/pull/118)
- Fixed problems in `masci_tools.testing.bokeh` when adding files for new bokeh versions [[#122]](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/pull/122)
- Several fixes for `plot_fleur_dos`. Using the `area_plot` or specifying `color` explicitly could mess up the color order [[#132]](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/pull/132)
- Fixed bug in `validate_nmmpmat` and consequently `FleurXMLModifier` not correctly validating denisty matrix files with certain off-diagonal elements being negative [[#135]](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/pull/135)
- Fix for `HDF5Reader` for compatibility for file handles in `aiida-core` 2.0. The file handles coming from the file repository have no directly attached extension so the check if the file is a hdf file cannot be performed

### For developers
- Fixed upload of pytest-mpl results artifacts to include the whole directory with images and not just the HTML file [[#117]](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/pull/117)
- Updated typing to newer version of `lxml-stubs` (`0.4.0`) [[#123]](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/pull/123)

## v.0.8.0
[full changelog](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/compare/v0.7.2...v0.8.0)

### Added
- Added `FleurInputSchema.xsd` and `FleurOutputSchema.xsd` for the MaX6 release of fleur (file version `0.35`) [[#112]](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/pull/112)
- New XML getter function: `get_special_kpoints` extracts the labelled kpoints from a kpoint list (for now only implemented for Max5 or later)
- Added extraction of Hubbard 1 input and distances in the `outxml_parser` for fleur (distances only available starting from version `0.35`) [[#108]](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/pull/108)
- Added extraction of global vector of magnetic moments in non-collinear calculations in `outxml_parser` under the key `magnetic_vec_moments` starting from version `0.35`

### Improvements
- Fleur schema parsing functions now recognize a new alias from the fleur schemas `FortranComplex` which is a number of the form `(float,float)`. Converters for complex values are added. (Note: Complex numbers should not yet be used in the `outxml_parser`, since AiiDA (<2.0) does not support complex numbers yet) [[#106]](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/pull/106)
- Added `IncompatibleSchemaVersions` error when a combination of output and input version for `OutputSchemaDict` is given, for which it is known that no XML schema can be compiled
- `xml_getters` functions can now be used in the task definitions of the `outxml_parser` to keep information consistent. This example definition will insert the structure data, i.e. a tuple of atoms, bravais matrix and periodic boundary conditions into the output dictionary. `{'parse_type':'xmlGetter', 'name': 'get_structure_data'}` [[#107]](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/pull/107)
- The `_conversions` key in the `outxml_parser` now accepts namedtuples `Conversion` to enable passing additional arguments to these functions. [[#109]](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/pull/109)
- Adjusted `get_cell` to understand the `bravaisMatrixFilm` input introduced with the MaX6 release of fleur [[#110]](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/pull/110)
- Improved detection, whether a given xpath contains a tag including stripping predicates. Added function `contains_tag` in `masci_tools.util.xml.common_functions` [[#113]](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/pull/113)
- Refactored bokeh plot routine `periodic_table_plot` to make use of the plot parameters utilities [[#114]](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/pull/114)
- `get_parameter_data` now extracts LOs with higher energy derivatives or `HELO` type, as they are supported by the newest versions of the inpgen. The old behaviour of dropping all non `SCLO` and `eDeriv="0"` LOs is available via the option `allow_special_los=False`
### Bugfixes
- Fix in ``load_inpxml`` and ``load_outxml`` (this also effects the ``inpxml/outxml_parser``). Previously file handle like objects not directly subclassing ``io.IOBase`` would lead to an exception
- Added patch for `OutputSchemaDict` objects with `FleurOutputSchema.xsd` files before version `0.35`. The attribute `qPoints` in the DMI output was actually called `qpoints` in these schemas, making it impossible to retrieve this attribute
- Fixed behaviour of relative XPath methods of `SchemaDict` which did not correctly handle root tags, whose names are contained in other tag names, for example `bravaisMatrix` and `bravaisMatrixFilm` from the new file version `0.35`

### Deprecated
- Passing strings in the `_conversions` key in task definitions for the `outxml_parser`. Use `masci_tools.util.parse_utils.Conversion` instead. [[#109]](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/pull/109)
### For developers
- Reorganized visualization tests, making the regeneration of baseline images with `pytest-mpl` easier [[#101]](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/pull/101)
- Switched build system from `setuptools` to `flit`, since this way all the configuration can be specified in the `pyproject.toml` and a lot of duplication of information is avoided (e.g. version numbers) [[#102]](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/pull/102)

## v.0.7.2
[full changelog](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/compare/v0.7.1...v0.7.2)

### Bugfixes
- Fixed regression in ``set_atomgroup_label`` and ``set_species_label``. These functions could be used in previous versions with atom labels, that do not exist. This is not possible in ``v.0.7.1``. Since some parts of the ``aiida-fleur`` plugin relied on this the behaviour has to be kept.

## v.0.7.1
[full changelog](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/compare/v0.7.0...v0.7.1)

### Added
- ``XPathBuilder`` class for specifying complex conditions on xpaths with a dictionary. Added ``filters`` argument to ``schema_dict_util`` and ``xml_setters`` functions for this dictionary [[#96]](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/pull/96)
### Bugfixes
- Fixed issue with ``MANIFEST.in``, where non-python files from the ``tools`` subpackage were not included in the built packages
- Fixed bug not correctly processing the plot limits in ``plot_fleur_bands`` in excluding points outside the plot area for better performance
- Fix for HDF5 transformation ``add_partial_sums`` if not all formatted patterns are present in the dataset, e.g. if a bandstructure/DOS is calculated for only selected atoms
### For developers
- More strict ``mypy`` configuration and moved a lot of the annotations to modern syntax with ``from __future__ import annotations``
- Added ``pyupgrade`` hook to automatically do some easy refactoring, i.e. removing compatibility workarounds move to modern syntax. Set to apply changes compatible with ``3.7`` and later

## v.0.7.0
[full changelog](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/compare/v0.6.2...v0.7.0)

Commandline interface, refactoring of SchemaDict/XML functions and major improvements for package configuration/tooling for developers. Added support for python ``3.10``. Dropped testing for python ``3.6``.
### Added
- Added click command line interface (available as ``masci-tools``). Can add Fleur XML Schema files with validation (Also directly pulled from the Fleur git), use the XML parsing functions and interface to the fleur visualization routines [[#49]](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/pull/49)
- Added ``Tabulator`` for use of creating ``pandas.Dataframes`` from attributes of python objects. Used in ``aiida-jutools`` to tabulate attributes of aiida nodes
- Added ``optional_tasks`` argument to ``outxml_parser``. Adds tasks marked with ``'_optional': True`` to the performed tasks [[#81]](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/pull/81)
- Added visualization routine for spectral functions (colormesh plot with path though Brillouin zone)
- Added tool for converting ``inp.xml`` files between different file versions (Available through the click CLI ``masci-tools inpxml``) [[#88]](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/pull/88)
- Added three new XML setters: ``clone_species`` (Create and modify a species starting from an existing one), ``switch_species``/``switch_species_label`` for switching the species attribute of atom groups with additional checks
- ``outxml_parser``: Total Energy is now taken from the output ``freeEnergy`` in the ``out.xml``
### Improvements
- Refactored SchemaDict code. Moved routines ``get_tag_xpath`` and similar to methods on the SchemaDict. If the path cannot be determined custom exceptions ``NoPathFound`` and ``NoUniquePathFound`` are now raised [[#84]](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/pull/84)
- Added utility to ``OutputSchemaDict`` to create absolute paths into ``iteration`` elements in ``out.xml``. Added support for this option in ``schema_dict_util`` functions with ``iteration_path=True``
- All basic XML modification functions now accept either a ``ElementTree`` or ``Element``. and warn they find no nodes to operate on
- Improved capabilities of green's function tool, can now be used with radially resolved/k-resolved Green's functions
- Improved performance of Fleur XML Schema parsing by switching from the ``xpath`` method on the ``ElementTree`` to constructing a ``XPathEvaluator`` object [[#89]](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/pull/89)
- All ``xml_getters`` functions can now also be used with ``out.xml`` files
- ``set_atomgroup``/``set_atomgroup_label`` now use ``switch_species`` if the species attribute is changed
- ``set_atomgroup`` now supports the ``all-<search string>`` syntax for species argument, equivalent to ``set_species``
- Improved behaviour of spin-polarized DOS plots for duplicating all plot parameters for spin-down components (previously only color was repeated)
### Bugfixes
- Fixed several issues in version handling of Schema dictionaries. It is now possible to add a new schema and have it work (with warnings) without needing to change any code (``masci-tools fleur-schema add <path/to/schema>``)
- Bugfix in ``evaluate_tag`` not handling the combination of options ``subtags=True`` and ``text=True`` correctly. Previously some results were overwritten.
- Fixed accidental change in ``write_inpgen_file`` in comparison to old ``aiida-fleur`` implementation. Now the species name is always appended to the position in the inpgen file if it is not equal to the atom symbol
- Fixed behaviour of ``get_parameter_data`` for inputs with local orbitals with higher energy derivatives. These cannot be created by the inpgen and so are dropped
- Fixes in ``xml_setters`` to allow consistent creation of multiple tags for setting text or attributes
### Deprecated
- The ``fleur_schema`` subpackage was moved from ``masci_tools.io.parsers.fleur`` to ``masci_tools.io.parsers`` to avoid circular import issues [[#87]](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/pull/87)
### Removed
- ``get_structure_data`` now returns ``AtomSiteProperties`` for the atom information by default. The default value of ``site_namedtuple`` is now ``True``
### For developers
- Moved configuration of ``yapf``, ``pylint`` and ``pytest`` into ``pyproject.toml``
- Made test suite executable from the root-folder (Some file paths were not transferrable when changing the execution directory)
- Added ``test_file`` fixture, which constructs the absolute filepath to files in the ``tests/files`` folder to reduce the difficulty of moving test files around and reorganizing the pytest suite
- Updated pylint (``2.11``), pytest (``6.0``) in ``setup.py``
- Added ``mypy`` pre-commit hook. Checked files are specified explicitly [[#86]](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/pull/86).
- Added typing to majority of XML functions (with stubs package ``lxml-stubs``) and large parts of the ``io`` and ``util`` subpackages
- Dropped testing for python ``3.6`` in CI

## v.0.6.2
[full changelog](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/compare/v0.6.1...v0.6.2)

Small bugfixes and refactoring for plotting routines
### Added
- Common plot routines for equation of states `eos_plot` and plotting scf convergence `convergence_plot`
- Replaced old convergence plot routines with single routines for bokeh/matplotlib named `plot_convergence`
### Improvements
- Moved eos and convergence plots to use `PlotData` class
- Fixed some edge cases of bokeh testing fixtures. Previously some plots would crash the code for normalizing the json
### Bugfixes
- Fixed bugs in convergence routines for using them in aiida-fleur

## v.0.6.1
Release fixing a small issue with publishing version `0.6.0` to zenodo
## v.0.6.0

[full changelog](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/compare/v0.5.0...v0.6.0)

This release contains major improvements to plotting methods and new tools. Also the fleur parsing functions were improved

### Added
- `PlotData` class for handling data passed to plotting methods very flexibly [[#54]](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/pull/54) (For more information see the relevant [users guide](https://masci-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/plotting.html#providing-data) or [developers guide](https://masci-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/devel_guide/plot_data.html) sections in the documentation)
- `masci_tools.vis.common` module for plotting methods with common interfaces for bokeh/matplotlib [[#71]](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/pull/71)
- `get_parameter_data` also extracts kpt mesh specifications for the input generator
- Exposed and improved bokeh testing fixtures in `masci_tools.testing.bokeh` for use in higher level packages
- `greensf_calculations` module in `tools` with sample functions for calculating properties with green's functions from fleur
- Added two options `line_plot` and `separate_bands` to bandstructure plots. While `line_plot` is obvious (no weighted bandstructures possible), `separate_bands` allows to set parameters for single selected bands. These options can also be combined

### Improvements
- Added option `only_used` to `get_kpoints_data` to get only the `kPointList` referenced in the `kPointListSelection` tag
- Made `constants` argument to `schema_dict_util` functions completely optional. Will raise an exception if a undefined constant is encountered
- Bandstructure plots now exclude points outside the plotting area to speed up these plots significantly for systems with a large number of bands
- Refactored attribute/text type definitions in `SchemaDict` objects. Now unified under one structure. Both attributes and texts can now be recognized to contain multiple values [[#64]](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/pull/64)
- Added `spin_arrows` option to toggle spin arrows in `plot_spinpol_dos` for matplotlib. Previously this was only possible for bokeh
- Added options to create different types of bar plots to `barchart`: Available are `'stacked'` (default), `'grouped'`, `'independent'` (positions can be defined for each data set)
- Exceptions occurring in `transforms` for `HDF5Reader` are now bundled into `HDF5TransformationError` to allow easier error handling
- Added MT keys to `kkrparams`

### Bugfixes
- Fix for `write_inpgen_file`, which was incorrectly inserting the `'X'` (empty sphere) element into inpgen files
- Fix for `read_inpgen_file`, which could not handle inpgen files with comments on certain lines in the inpgen file
- Several fixes for `plot_fleur_dos` not using the standard DOS calculation but orbital decompositions and so on
- Adjusted default `dpi` for matplotlib to `100` to avoid problems with size when using `plt.show()` instead of saving

## v.0.5.0

[full changelog](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/compare/v0.4.10...v0.5.0)

This release contains fleur inpgen IO capabilities and many major improvements

### Added
- IO routines for reading/writing inpgen input files
- `get_structure_data` now returns the relaxed structure if a `relaxation` section is present

## v.0.4.7

[full changelog](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools/compare/v0.4.6...v0.4.7)

### Added
- Introduced higher level XML modification functions for `xml_delete_tag`, `xml_delete_att`, `xml_replace_tag`

- Added missing energy unit alias for  Fleur input files
- `xml_delete_tag`, `xml_delete_att`, `xml_replace_tag` now also support the `occurrences` argument
- FleurXMLModifier improvements. Modification registration methods will now test the given arguments against the modifying functions immediately to fail early for errors. `fromList` classmethod allows the instantiation with a known list of tasks to perform. These are passed through the same procedure as the normal registration of changes

## v.0.4.6
