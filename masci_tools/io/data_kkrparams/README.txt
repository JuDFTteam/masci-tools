Here we keep the defaults and settings used in the kkrparams class as dictionaries in json format.

The convention is the following for all keywords:

    keyword: [
        Default value (None means unset),
        formatting string (used to write this input to the input file),
        required value (True/False),
        description (docstring for this parameter)    
    ]
