    List of external implementations:

    - aiida-jutools/io `NodeTabulator` for nodes -> pandas DataFrame.

    TODO: increase memory performance:

    The following points are meant for the `NodeTabulator` implementation, but may be of interest for other
    implementations.

    - use optional dtypes from recipe (see TODO in Recipe) when building table. otherwise, e.g. when returning
      pandas dataframe, all columns will have dtype 'object' or 'float64' and the table won't fit into memory
      anymore very quickly.
    - internal storage format dict of lists while building must remain, but when finished, convert to dict
      of numpy arrays -> more memory efficient. for repeated tabulate() calls (to build larger table), have
      to adjust code to concatenate new lists to existing numpy arrays when finished.
    - change tabulate() signature: should not return table, only build it. another method (e.g. table @property
      getter) should return table and before del (delete) its inner storage (self._table) of it, because return
      will likely create a copy. that way can ~half the memory footprint.
    - when returning pandas dataframe, and recipe supplied no dtypes, use automatic downcasting to smallest dtype
      for numeric types (pd.to_numeric), and maybe 'categorical' for string coluns (if num unique values << num
      values). See pandas > Scaling to large datasets for more.
    - maybe add save option (or method) and read() method to read in tabulated table. for pandas, that allow a user
      to easily reuse the dtypes information from the recipe.
