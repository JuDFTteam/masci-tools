    """Recipe for a :py:class:`~.tabulator.Tabulator`.

    Recipes hold the include, exclude list of properties which a tabulator should put into a table, by reading
    them from a set of objects, one row per object. In other words, the recipe specifies the column of the table.
    Transformations of properties for the table (say, a property is a list, and we only want the maximum), can
    be defined by specifying a transformer in the recipe.

    TODO: improve memory performance for tabulation:

    - let include exclude lists values optionally hold pandas dtype strings (numpy 'uint8' etc plus pandas types like
      'categorical'; the latter internally in tabulator replaced by numpy correspondence where needed). tabulator
      will use those when building table. otherwise, e.g. when returning pandas dataframe, all columns will
      have dtype 'object' or 'float64' and the table won't fit into memory anymore very quickly.

    def __init__(self, exclude_list: dict = None, include_list: dict = None, transformer: Transformer = None, **kwargs):
        """Initialize a recipe for a :py:class:`~.tabulator.Tabulator`.

        The attributes :py:attr:`~.include_list` and :py:attr:`~.exclude_list` control which properties
        are to be tabulated (=table columns). A tabulator defines an `autolist` method which can auto-generate
        an extensive include list from a given object. This can be used to define a custom include or exclude list
        for objects of that use case.

        Subclasses define the nature of the objects to be tabulated by making assumptions on their
        property structure. That way, if both include and exclude list are empty, by default the 'complete'
        set of properties of the objects will be tabulated, where the subclass defines the notion of 'complete'.

        If neither exclude nor include list is given, the full set of properties according to implementation
        will be tabulated.

        There are three accepted formats for the include and exclude lists, here shown for an example of an
        AiiDA workchain node (for aiida-jutools `NodeTabulator`). In this example, the objects to be a tabulated
        are nodes in a database, and they have a unique identifier ('uuid'), a label, and some attributes called
        'extras' and 'outputs' with many nested properties inside them. The selection here will tell a tabulator
        to only put those properties in a table.
