# masci-tools

**This is a collection of tools, common things used by packages of material science.**

Feel free to contribute.

The code is hosted on GitHub at
<https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools>

The documentation is hosted on https://masci-tools.readthedocs.io.

Most functionality was developed for the use with the DFT codes developed at the Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich (see <http://judft.de>, <https://flapw.de> and <https://jukkr.fz-juelich.de> for further information on the codes) and in the context of the AiiDA plugins for the [Fleur code](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/aiida-fleur) and the [KKR code](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/aiida-kkr).

## Installation

```
pip install masci-tools
```

## Dependencies

These python packages are needed:
* `lxml`
* `h5py`
* `deepdiff`
* `humanfriendly`  
* `matplotlib`
* `seaborn`
* `ase`
* `pymatgen`
* `mendeleev`

It should not depend on `aiida-core`!

## Layout of`masci-tools`

* `io`
    * Contains methods to write certain files
    * `io.parsers`: Contains parsers of certain code output or input files
* `tests`
