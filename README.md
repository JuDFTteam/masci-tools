# masci-tools

Masci-tools (short for "materials science tools") is a post-processing toolkit for electronic structure calculations. Its well-documented Python interface simplifies I/O parsing, visualization such as bandstructure and DOS plotting, and data analysis.

Feel free to contribute.

The code is hosted on GitHub at
<https://github.com/JuDFTteam/masci-tools>

The documentation is hosted on https://masci-tools.readthedocs.io.

Most functionality was developed for the use with the DFT codes developed at the Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich (<http://judft.de>) and their AiiDA plugins for high-throughput calculations ([aiida-fleur](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/aiida-fleur), [aiida-kkr](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/aiida-kkr), [aiida-spirit](https://github.com/JuDFTteam/aiida-spirit)).

## Installation

```
pip install masci-tools
```

## Dependencies

These python packages are needed:
* `lxml`
* `h5py`
* `deepdiff`
* `humanfriendly`  
* `matplotlib`
* `seaborn`
* `ase`
* `pymatgen`
* `mendeleev`
* `click`
* `click-completion`
* `PyYAML`
* `tabulate`

It should not depend on `aiida-core`!

## Layout of `masci-tools`

* `io`
    * Contains methods to write certain files
    * `io.parsers`: Contains parsers of certain code output or input files
* `testing`
    * Contains utilities/fixtures for testing that can be useful outside the package
* `util`
    * Contains rather low-level utility
* `tools`
    * Contains rather high-level utility which is rather complete
* `vis`
    * Contains a collection of matplotlib/bokeh methods used for plotting common results from material science simulations, e.g. bandstructures, DOS, ... 
* `cmdline`
    * Contains a small click command line interface exposing some parts of the library
